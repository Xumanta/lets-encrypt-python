## General

This project uses Lukas2511's dehydrated shell script as the basis for deploying certificates to an F5 BIG-IP.

For the DNS challenge it uses OVH.com's API and then utilizes F5's iControl REST interface to upload and configure the certificates into a clientssl profile for SSL offloading capability.

Thanks to ACMEv2 it is also possible to deploy wildcard certificates. The clientssl profile will have the asterisk replaced with "wildcard" for the given wildcard domain.

## Usage

I assume, that you clone this git into /opt/lead/ and let it run from there.

1. You need to create an application within OVH (https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh#1-create-an-application)
2. Put the app details into ovh.conf - except consumer key
3. Put your correct zone name into request_token.py
4. Run request_token.py to get a consumer key
5. Put the consumer key also into ovh.conf
6. Make sure your domains are in config/domains.txt and your using the correct Let's Encrypt API (config/config.sh)
7. Run ./dehydrated --accept-terms -c -f /opt/lead/lets-encrypt-python/config/config.sh
8. (recommended) Turn it into a cron job
